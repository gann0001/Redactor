If you like adult comedy cartoons, like South Park, then this is nearly a similar format about the small adventures of three teenage girls at Bromwell High. ******, ******* and Latrina have given exploding sweets and behaved like bitches, I think ****** is a good leader. There are also small stories going on with the teachers of the school. There's the idiotic principal, *******, the nervous Maths teacher and many others. The cast is also fantastic, ***** *****'s **** *******, EastEnders Chrissie Watts, Tracy-Ann Oberman, Smack The Pony's **** *********, **** *******' **** ***** and *******'s **** *****. I didn't know this came from Canada, but it is very good. Very good!
